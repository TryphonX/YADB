# YADSB (Yet Another Discord Server Bot)
###### ~~Couldn't come up with anything better~~

A discord bot coded using discord.js

This bot has been created mainly to gain more experience; however it's still a functional bot.

>__Note:__ The bot is personal project, also currently a WIP. I can not guarantee there won't be any bugs or things I might have missed. Feel free to submit your ideas or report bugs __[here](https://github.com/TryphonX/YADSB/issues/new)__.

## Getting Started

### Familiar with Discord apps?

All you have to do is create an app. Download and install the latest Node.js version you can find __[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)__. Then download the project anywhere in your computer and `Shift + Right-click` inside the main folder (make sure you haven't selected any of the files). You will see the option to open the folder with "command window" or "PowerShell" for windows -or your operating system's equivalent. Type `npm install` and wait for the downloads to finish.

### Not familiar with Discord apps?

In order to run the bot, you will need the basic discord.js libraries. If you have no idea how to get them, follow __[this guide](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/the-long-version.html)__.

## Configuration

Locate the `config.example.ini` file and rename it to `config.ini`. Then open the file with any text/code editor. The comments in the file will help you configure the bot.

## Launch

Open the command window (or PowerShell) or your OS's equivalent inside the `src` folder and type `node yadsb.js`.

__Alternatively__, if you are on Windows and feel comfortable with using a batch file run the `run.bat` file to start the bot automatically.

>__Note:__ It is recommended use the terminate command when you want to stop the bot (before of closing the terminal).
